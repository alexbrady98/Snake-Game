// Issues
// Snake element - remains outside the stage after I fail so constant fail thereafter// fixed
// Food randomises indefinitely and when i use draw food in the loop it does not randomise when collided with // fixed
// Snake can go outside of the stage
// Snake is shifting and popping regardless of wether the snake ate food or not - need to fix in the interval function// fixed
//^ above is now causing multiple gameovers making it difficult to restart // Fixed declaring the loop in a variable and putting it in gameOver function

// To do after fixing bugs
// add self collision with longer snake body
// add a game over screen
//
// Optional - add harder levels if I have time
